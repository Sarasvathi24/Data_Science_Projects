## Introduction
This project aims to predict the type of telecommunication services offered to customers based on various demographic and behavioral features. By analyzing these predictions, we aim to help telecommunication companies tailor their services for targetted marketing and improve customer retention.

## 1. Business Understanding

Problem:
Telecommunication companies face high customer churn and inefficiencies in service offerings.
Main Goal:
Predict the most suitable telecommunication services for customers based on their demographic and behavioral features.
Main Objective: 
Develop accurate predictive models for service prediction to assist in future decision-making.

## 2. Analytic Approach

The analytic approach involves:
To solve the problem, we use classification model specifically K Nearest Neighbours algorithm. These model will help in understanding the relationship between demographic features and type of service, and predict suitable service for targetted marketing.

## 3. Data Requirements

The dataset should include the following features:
- **region**: Geographical location of the customer.
- **tenure**: Duration of the customer relationship with the company.
- **age**: Age of the customer.
- **marital**: Marital status 
- **address**: Type of residence 
- **income**: Customerâ€™s income level.
- **ed**: Highest level of education attained.
- **employ**: Current employment status 
- **retire**: Whether the customer is retired.
- **gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **reside**: Type of residence or housing situation.

## 4. Data Collection

The dataset is provided in a CSV file named teleCust1000t.csv, containing detailed information about various demographic and behavioural features.

## 5. Data Understanding

This phase involves constructing the dataset and understanding its structure and quality. It includes exploring the data, identifying any missing values, and understanding the relationships between different features.

## 6. Data Preparation

Data preparation involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Normalisation/Standardisation**: Scaling features to ensure equal contribution to model training.
- **Splitting Data**: Dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

## 7. Modeling

The modeling phase involves selecting and applying K Nearest Neighbours algorithm. These models will help predict type of communication services (Basic Service, E Service, Plus Service or Total Service) based on the features in the dataset.

## 8. Evaluation

Model evaluation involves:
The models will be evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics will help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.

## 9. Libraries Used

The following libraries and tools will be used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
