## Introduction
This project aims to analyze an automotive dataset to understand the factors influencing CO2 emission and to build predictive models. This analysis will provide valuable insights for manufacturers, environmentalists, and buyers, helping them make informed decisions. The methodology is structured into several key steps, each critical for the successful completion of the data science project.

## 1. Business Understanding
Data science methodology begins with spending the time to seek clarification. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
Our problem here is finding the value of the CO2 Emission.

Main Goal: Predict the value of CO2 emission based on single independent variable.
Main Object: Building a predictive model.

## 2. Analytic Approach
To solve the problem, I have used Single Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression algorithms in my first project . Now, we are going to analyse the accuracy by using Polynomial Regression algorithm. These model will help in understanding the relationship between car features and carbon emission, and predict future emission.

## 3. Data Requirements
The dataset includes the following features:
- **MODELYEAR**: The year of the vehicle model.
- **MAKE**: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **MODEL**: The specific model of the vehicle.
- **VEHICLECLASS**: The classification of the vehicle.
- **ENGINESIZE**: The size of the engine in liters.
- **CYLINDERS**: The number of cylinders in the engine.
- **TRANSMISSION**: Type of transmission.
- **FUELTYPE**: Type of fuel used.
- **FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY**: Fuel consumption in the city in liters per 100 km.
- **FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY**: Fuel consumption on the highway in liters per 100 km.
- **FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB**: Combined fuel consumption in liters per 100 km.
- **FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG**: Combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon.
- **CO2EMISSIONS**: The amount of CO2 emitted in grams per kilometer.

## 4. Data Collection
The dataset is provided in a CSV file named FuelConsumption.csv, containing detailed information about various features.

## 5. Data Understanding
DatThis phase involves constructing the dataset and understanding its structure and quality. It includes exploring the data, identifying any missing values, and understanding the relationships between different features.

## 6. Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalise or standardize data, encode categorical variables, and apply any necessary transformations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features and create new features that may improve model performance.

## 7.  Modeling
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The modeling phase involves applying Polynomial Regression. These models will help predict CO2 emission based on the features in the dataset.

## 8. Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).
- These metrics will help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.
- Validate the model using the testing data to ensure it generalizes well to new data.
