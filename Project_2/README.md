## 1. Business Understanding
**Problem:** The primary goal is to predict car prices based on various features. This will assist stakeholders in making more informed decisions.

**Main Goal:** Predict car prices using both single and multiple variables.

**Main Objective:** Develop accurate predictive models for vehicle pricing to assist in future decision-making.

## 2. Analytic Approach
To solve the problem, we will use Single Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression algorithms. These models will help in understanding the relationship between car features and prices, and predict future prices.

## 4. Data Collection
The dataset is provided in a CSV file named `automobileEDA.csv`, containing detailed information about various car models.

## 5. Data Understanding
This phase involves constructing the dataset and understanding its structure and quality. It includes exploring the data, identifying any missing values, and understanding the relationships between different features.

## 6. Data Preparation
Data preparation, along with data collection and understanding, is one of the most time-consuming phases of a data science project. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, transforming variables, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

## 7. Modeling
The modeling phase involves selecting and applying suitable regression models, specifically Single Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. These models will help predict car prices based on the features in the dataset.

## 8. Evaluation
The models will be evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score. These metrics will help assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.
